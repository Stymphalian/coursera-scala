# Coursera - Scala
A repository to track my progress through the course.

# Purpose
I took "CSC330: Programming Lanaguages" at school this last semester (Jan - April 2015).We learned funtcional programming through _SML_ and _Racket_. Our professor recommended that we invest sometime into learning Scala as he thought it would be a prominent language over the next 5 years. So here I am trying to learn a new language hoping that it pays off  : )

# Goals
* For fun. I love learing new programming languages. It is always cool to see what unique features are added to the languages and seeing what things become easier or harder because of them. These features usually open my eyes to new or alternate methods of solving the same problems.
* Get more experience with functional languages.
* Finish the course before the May 16/2015. I have a lot of free time before I get a job, so I hope to be done the course sooner rather than later.
